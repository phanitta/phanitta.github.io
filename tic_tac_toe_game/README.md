<h1> Tic-Tac-Toe Game </h1>
<h2> Player vs. Computer </h2>

This program consists of a Game Class that takes care of all the game logic. All that we need to run the game is to create a Game object and call <i>run()</i> in the main program. The game will continue to run until either of the player wins or gets a tie. There are 4 states to this game as called by the <i>checkBoardState()</i> function: incomplete, a tie, "x" wins, and "o" wins.
